# Dataset Overview

This project uses the following two CSV files provided by Kaggle:

- [`train.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/data)
- [`training_extra.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/data)

Please download both files and place them in the `data/` directory of this project.

Once the files are in place, you can generate a processed dataset used for AI analysis and querying by running the following command:

```bash
python combine_data.py
