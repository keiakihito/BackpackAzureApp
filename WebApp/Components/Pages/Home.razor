<h1>Welcome to the Backpack Data Assistant!</h1>

<p>
    This app lets you interact with backpack product data stored in Azure SQL through a natural language interface.  
    Behind the scenes, your questions are converted into SQL queries—allowing you to explore data just by asking in plain English!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>🧠 Ask questions like a conversation and discover <strong>prices, features, and product trends</strong></li>
    <li>📊 Browse the <strong>complete product list in a table format</strong> (with pagination)</li>
    <li>☁️ All data is securely stored in <strong>Azure SQL</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Use the menu on the left to access the <strong>Backpack List</strong> and explore the dataset.

    🧪 <strong>Note:</strong> This app uses sample data for testing purposes.
    You are free to <strong>edit or delete</strong> backpack entries via the UI to test CRUD functionality.
    However, the AI assistant is <strong>read-only</strong> and does not modify any data.
